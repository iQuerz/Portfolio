                            I am a passionate software engineer with a knack for developing innovative solutions.
                            With a strong foundation in education and experience in various fields,
                            I have successfully delivered numerous projects that stand out for their creativity and technical excellence.

                        <p>
                            I love the art of solving problems, no matter the difficulty, and programming has been a genuine enjoyment for me since my childhood.

                            I'm a team player, as no one man has done anything great. I love working with the team, as one.

                        Tempus is a big .NET Blazor app, created for a steel construction company's needs. It manages construction projects by tracking various data points,
                        like time spent on tasks by each employee and materials used for each project.
                        It then uses all of this data to give the users a detailed breakdown of project costs,
                        as well as answering the question of "Who did what, when & where",
                        offering a cost prediction for future projects and by result, increasing the company's throughput.

                    <p>
                        I have designed and developed it by myself & It is being actively used in my Dad's steel construction company.
                        I do not have any compensation for this as I did it solely in my free time, out of my love for software engineering.
